# **App Name**: MultiViewSport Reimagined

## Core Features:

- Welcome Screen: A welcome screen greets users with a title and brief instructions on how to use the app.
- Channel List: Displays a list of predefined sports channel links that users can copy to their clipboard with a button click. The button briefly changes color on click for feedback.
- Camera Configuration: Allows users to select the number of simultaneous views (1-4) and input the corresponding URLs.
- Event List: Opens a new view with an embedded iframe loading a predefined URL listing sports events. (e.g., https://streamtp4.com/eventos.html)
- Start View: Navigates to a display screen showing the selected number of iframes, each loading a user-provided sports stream.
- Close Button: A button on the display screen returns users to the input screen, preserving the entered stream links for further adjustments.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean backdrop.
- Primary: Dark gray (#333333) to ensure text and important UI elements are readable.
- Accent: A slightly lighter gray (#666666) indicates interactivity, used on button and input borders in their default state.
- Sans-serif fonts for all UI text to maintain clarity and modernity.
- Simple monochromatic line icons complement the design in gray tones.
- Employ a minimal design with flexible iframe grid based on camera count (1x1, 1x2, 2x2) for various screens.
